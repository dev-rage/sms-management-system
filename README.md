# Student Management System (SMS) Database  
### SQL Database Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a relational database for a Student Management System (SMS) using SQL. The database efficiently stores and manages information related to students, courses, instructors, and enrollments.

It supports core administrative operations such as student registration, course assignment, and the generation of dynamic reports through SQL queries.

The project demonstrates the practical use of SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML), including the creation of tables with appropriate constraints, as well as the use of complex queries and JOIN operations to retrieve meaningful insights from the database.

## Database Features
- Student and course data management
- Enrollment tracking
- Data integrity enforcement
- Report generation using SQL queries

Student Management System database, showing entities, attributes, and the
relationships between students, courses, departments, instructors and enrollments.
